Yeah, everyday task.
Client:
So, Monday I go to, uh that's my day-off Monday.
Interviewer:
Okay..
Client:
And on Tuesday, uh I am here in my two stores. On Wednesday, I have basically two stores here, the one that you saw that's JS12 and then another one 3D12 just a wing in the front.

In the front, here in 168?
Client:

Interviewer:
Okay..
Client:
And uhm, Wednesday I have to visit another store in Baclaran, so that's basically wholesale store before, but now it's going retail already. But these stores of mine here are wholesale and retail also.
Interviewer:
Wholesale and retail?
Client:
Yeah, and then on Thursdays I come here for store visits also with the 2 stores and on Friday I have my church duty, and Saturday I'm here also, I man the store. And on Sundays it's my day-off.
Interviewer:
Ah okay, so any ano, any possible, ano, wala naman noh? Okay so, again, based on the information given to us by Hiroki, uh Giovana is a clothing company that record its inventories manually thru logbooks. Is that correct?
Client:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
Uh, who does this task?
Client:
Me.
Interviewer:
Is there anybody else po? It's just you?
Client:
All me, yeah.
Interviewer:
So, for all branches it's you who do that?
Client:
Yeah, it’s me who do that. So, imagine I don't have any computer I have only notebooks and I have only 4, no, 3 wholesale shop that is wholesale/retail. But I have 5 who's doing wholesale, ah I mean retailing. So those are my Cinderella branches. I have in Glorietta, Alabang Town Center, in virra mall, in SM Megamall, and in Robinson's Ermita, and festival mall. I have 5, those are retail
Interviewer:
So again, uh, 5 wholesale, is that correct?
Client:
No no, 5 retail.
Interviewer:
5 retail
Client:
3 wholesale
Interviewer:
3 wholesale
Client:
3 wholesale, retail
Interviewer:
3 wholesale and retail, both sila
Client:
Yeah, both sila.
Interviewer:
Ah okay. So, may sabihin ka?
Interviewer[Kit]:
Ask ko lang po, if, since kayo po yung laging nag rerecord, every when niyo po ginagawa yung?
Client:
Ah so, every day we have staffs here, kasi daily to eh, Monday to Sunday it's open, so from 8AM-7PM  open yun, so every day we have a sale I'll show you nalang, ay I forgot.
Interviewer:
Okay..
Client:
They login their sale for example, 1 piece and then, uh, at 500 pesos and they will record what is the item and then who sold it. I have 3 girls kasi eh, so I will find out if there's any problem I will direct to that girl. So, every time they log, they are the one who sell, they are the one who log and they're the one who's going to put their names. So yun yung basically the manner of. (SHOW LOGBOOK)
Interviewer:
Of writing the ano…
Client:
Yes, writing, yeah. So at the end of the day, they will total it. There's a total sale and then number of pieces that they sold out for the day. So those are the routine daily and then if there is an expenses they will minus that to the total, subtract it. So then, I have a deposit slip every time that uh, that I will bring to the bank. Me only and my husband will do that but if we're not here they just have to staple everything and then wait for us till the next day.
Interviewer:
Oh, so para ma-deposit po sa bank?
Client:
Yeah, deposit sa bank because I have to double check everything.
Interviewer:
Ah, okay okay.
Client:
So if they have expenses, they will just subtract it from the total, so that the daily routine of this business, so but I have a main book for that, I keep it, that's the daily sales for the day, the detailed and then I have this one, that I make. For example, this is my dates, this is the total sale, so this is the summary of the day eh, and then I have the expenses and then the deposit so that, that is my record keeping for my own. But the details is there in the store, the log.
Interviewer:
Details of the logs are in the store, and then ina-accumulate niyo po lahat sa isang logbook.
Client:
For a month. Then, I analyze my sale so from 2013, so when my store open, no no
Interviewer:
Ever since pa, back then. Ah ah.
Client:
Old pa yan talaga, I have those, I keep it so  from, so basically I know if I'm doing good because I have or I'm doing bad, I have gauge, so aside from this record keeping every month my daily sales, I have the yearly, which I have, so like, like I'm doing bad talaga. 2007 this is my gross, 9.3M but now, my gross is like 3.7M so that's why I'm thinking of going out to the retail business so that's why I told you I have 5 businesses already for retail at Cinderella. I have to compensate this to keep up with my expenditures for our family so I need to think, it means that, I don’t, I don’t know I analyzed and I don’t have any problems with retailing because my retail before and now is the same diba I told I have retail and wholesale here.
Interviewer:
Retail and wholesale yes.
Client:
The factor that was gone by 50% is my wholesale. I lost in wholesaling.
Interviewer:
50%  of the wholesale
Client:
So now, I'm now into the retail, it just you know a parang a nursery for me, that I'm going out little by little from wholesaling and go to the market of retailing. So that's why I'm in the process of doing that, so I need more  system, like you know like the one that you are going to develop for me to be able to be efficient. (SHOW LOGBOOK)
Interviewer[Glenn]:
Uhm, can I see po the following page?
Client:
Uh this one?
Interviewer:
Uh no no, the following page.
Client:
So uh, I do this weekly eh.
Interviewer[Glenn]:
This is the net or
Client:
This is the gross sales for year and it's the total gross of the month
Interviewer:
So, the puhunan po ba is included there, or revenue
Client:
No it's gross, gross.
Interviewer:
Ah, gross
Client:
It's the gross, its overall so, I don’t have pa the capital and then I have this book, I'll show you pala, I forgot to bring everything. So I have those eh; that is so magulo that I want to fix but then I have kasi cutoff to know that if I’m really having a good net kasi every month I go to Hong Kong, I bring this certain capital. So for example, I will go to Hong Kong on November 11 ah on January 18, on Monday. I'm returning on January 21 so 3 days I'll be there to purchase. So I have this amount, I'll bring it with me and then that is my capital. And then, after a month shipment will come. So if the shipment will come on, for example, Ah after a month so 18, February 18 it will come. So I will write down on my log book. I have another logbook that I will write February 18, stocks coming. So I will write there at February 18, my total capital for example I have 800,000 for that. So February 18 until the next shipment that I will go out to Hong Kong again, I will total everything, summarize everything and then uhm, for example I've sold for a month like 1M, and I will, to know my net, so I will less the capital that I bought from Hong Kong last month, for example 800,000 and I have 1.2. So I have
Interviewer:
Which is 1.2, which is the gross.
Client:
The gross, so i-leless ko dun sa 800 ko, so basically I have 400,000, so that's my income. That's my net. But then, I have inventories, 50% I'm not yet selling, it's all there in my store. So it's, it's uh that's also my kita na but then it's still not liquid. So every time I have like that.
Interviewer:
So, this other logbook po, yung sinasabi niyo po na.
Client:
Oh, I need to bring it.
Interviewer:
Yeah, but like what's in it. Yung stocks niyo po, tama ba? Yung nanggaling po, yung shipment.
Client:
Uh, I have kasi this is my monthly and I have the one that I told that has a date February 18, 800,000 that's capital and then the total of all the stores. I'll show you eh, the total of all the stores, halimbawa I have 8 stores, there's a column, that the gross of the first store,  the gross of the second, the 3rd, the 4th, the 6th, the 7th and then I will total it to know how much did I get the gross out of those stores that I have.
Interviewer:
Uh, may I ask lang po, do you keep inventory of the stocks that you have other than the calculations of the inventory uh calculations of the revenue, and expenses and all other stuff.
Client:
In my retail I have. So my five shops in Cinderella; Alabang town center, Glorietta, SM Megamall and the Ermita, meron ako nun. Kasi I deliver, there's a receipt and then parang like this. For example of my retail, uh, example in Glorietta so this is the one that I have. So these are the receipts.
Interviewer:
Those are the receipts po of the uh
Client:
Of the, uh my delivery receipts.
Interviewer:
Delivery receipts.
Client:
Yeah, and then I have number of pieces.
Interviewer:
Number of pieces.
Client:
Yeah, so this is the.. And then I have also pull outs. But my reporting for the daily sale is like this, there's a total and then every, every transaction, because they just text it to me eh, so I, thru text message I receive them so I will write down their quantity. Yeah.
Interviewer:
Kung ano po yung nabenta.
Client:
Kung ano yung nabenta nila for the day.
Interviewer:
Presyo..
Client:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
And then yung total?
Client:
And then yung total, and then meron ako  nung, uh, uh number of apparels I will subtract it every time at the end like this. For example those are.. Did you notice that every at the end, I have uh, yeah apparel, accessories, so I have, parang everyday I subtract it.
Interviewer:
So eto na po yung ano, yung difference nung na subtract na po siya. Eto na po yung..
Client:
Oo, eto na yun, kasi..
Interviewer:
Eto na yung current status niya po after the day.
Client:
Every day I have current.
Interviewer:
Yeah, okay.
Client:
This is for my retail, and I have 5 of that kasi I have 5 branches, so I do it..
Interviewer:
5.. 5 na ganito.
Client:
Oo 5 branches.
Interviewer:
Uh, one per store?
Client:
Uh sorry?
Interviewer:
One per store po?
Client:
One per store, one per store.
Interviewer:
So this is for the retail po, what about the other branches, yung tatlong branches po, yung dalawa sa…
Client:
Yun, that's my problem kasi here I can keep track of it kasi I, I have only one sales girl there, who will man the store and then she also has this thing the record and I tell her also to record down every time the inventories, parang sometimes we have a discrepancy to the number of quantity, so I have to store-visit and sometimes I don't really know why kulang. I don't know.
Interviewer:
They don't add up?
Client:
Ha?
Interviewer:
They don't add up?
Interviewer:
Di po nag-aadd up po yung mga mga narecord tsaka sa..
Client:
Sometimes, siguro I have yeah.
Interviewer:
.. Sa physical
Client:
Yeah sa physical.
Interviewer:
Ganun.
Client:
So that's the problem that I have eh, or baka manually I have mistaken you know because I'm the only one who do everything in a day's time, so probably.
Interviewer:
It's a lot, it's a lot.
Client:
Oo nalimutan ko na, so a lot talaga to do everything. Kaya parang I feel na baka nagkakamali rin ako somewhere in that week tapos na-accumulate na, so nagka-problem ako eh.
Interviewer:
So in those 3 stores po, confirm ko lang, yung nag rerecord, yung nandun po sa branch?
Client:
Oo yung daily sales.
Interviewer:
Hindi po kayo.
Client:
Ay, I have.
Interviewer:
You have din may ganun din for the 3.
Client:
for a month. Then, I analyze my sale so from 2013, so when my store open, no no
Interviewer:
Yung storage po?
Client:
All storage, and then I don't go there kasi it's really you know, sobrang daming laman. They are the ones who just go and get stocks. Pero I don't really ask them to count everything, pero actually this is the first year that.. I mean 2nd year na kami nag reretail so my husband is parang not used to retailing. Sabi namin, before, I have the revenue already after a month kasi nga wholesale finish, everything finish. Now, I have so much stocks kasi nga retail is very mabagal. It's slower compared to wholesale, so ngayon nagpa inventory siya dun sa mga staffs ko, nakita niya "Oh my goodness you have 70% of the stocks not yet sold out". So that's where our money goes, so yun nga parang actually this December lang siya nagpa-count talaga ng lahat. But I haven't really reconciled it with what we have. Yeah. So yun ang problem ko dito sa wholesale, sa retail walang problem kasi I have the girls, tapos small quantities lang sila eh meron lang sila pinakamarami na nila is 500 pieces per store other stores are 200-250 pieces lang. So this Glorietta is very mabilis siya, it's parang pinaka top 1 ko. So she can keep like, tska I have storage there, so she can keep like 600-700 stocks, pero dito I have like million stocks here.
Interviewer:
Here?
Client:
Oo, pieces ah, so yeah. Ah no, million in amount pero the pieces is probably around 5,000 pieces.
Interviewer:
Yung worth niya po mga around a million?
Client:
More than.
Interviewer:
Ah yung sa upstairs ng store, yun yung lahat?
Client:
Dito.
Interviewer:
Diba meron po siya sa itaas.
Client:
May mezzanine eh, so those are the storage.
Interviewer:
Storage.
Client:
Storage room namin ang nandun sa taas. So yung problem ko talaga yung physical na quantity hindi ko mabilang dito at tska sometimes kaya nga we man the store kasi I don’t have any problem with the Cinderella kasi may cashier sila, it's really ah, it is a system. There's a sales girl or the sales girl is not handling the cash so meron centralized, tska yung inventory namin doon is ang dali kasi few pieces lang. Pero pag dating dito the problem is with the amount kasi fixed amount dun sa retail eh, we have barcode eh, here wala eh, they can just tell me "Ay I did a wholesale" pero it's really different. The price from retail and wholesale is is almost half the price. So if we won't man it, we will lose kasi they  can declare as wholesale pero actually it's retail. So, kaya I really have to be in the store every time, so alternate kami ng husband ko, if I'm here he's off, if I'm off he's here.
Interviewer:
So, question again po, yung dito po, yung dalawang stores niyo po dito again siya po yung maraming storage, siya po yung maraming stocks.
Client:
Oo siya yung maraming stocks.
Interviewer:
And yung branches po dito,uh, they are both retail and wholesale.
Client:
Retail and wholesale.
Interviewer:
So they're both?
Client:
Yeah.
Interviewer:
In the other branches po, not much problem in recording the inventory and the other calculations for expenses and revenue. So, ito lang talaga the problem with inventory and uh, miscalculations of total inventory and uh pretty much the general idea of taking down the inventory. So, we would.. San po ba yung mas malaking problem niyo sa wholesale or retail tracking?
Client:
Ah, yung wholesale kasi basically kasi pag wholesale talagang ang hirap mag uhh, number of pieces, uh retailing naman ang problem there is madali siya mag count pero daily eh.
Interviewer:
Tska yung tawad po diba?
Client:
Yung tawad, yeah. Dito kasi mahirap, wala fixed price eh. That's my problem here, kaya I really have to be here in store, kasi dun sa ano barcoding kaya walang problema eh.
Interviewer:
So you're the one who's gonna say how much discount is a person's gonna get right?
Client:
But I, I tell them that's the last, last, they know the last price, they know the price na regular and yung pinakasagad na presyo they know na iba iba yung price diba.
Interviewer:
Uh, okay, so you mentioned po nakakabili po ng wholesale po yung mga customers. Paano po siya narerecord sa logbook?
Client:
Uhm, every day kasi meron kami log tapos retailing yun noh, tapos pag wholesale it's big amount noh, halimbawa pag retail 1,500, 200, 300, tapos they will they have a separate invoice for the wholesale. Parang basically ganito yung wholesale eh. (SHOW LOGBOOK)
Interviewer:
Pero ano po, kapag rinecord din po siya sa logbook ng branch it will be recorded as parang wholesale pero parang pareho lang like lalagay rin yung quantity.
Client:
Halimbawa, uh I'll bring nga the ano, I'll call the girl para to bring the ano one of the notebooks that they use. Oh sige you can ask me questions again.




Interviewer:
So, uh next question, say po you have unsellable stock, how do you get rid of these unsellable stock?
Client:
Basically, I adjust kasi lahat ng mga stocks ko ay basic. So, sometimes kaya ako bumibili ng over because I don't want to go every time to Hong Kong so I really have to have stock para, kasi busy rin ako I have many obligations here. So, I purchase talaga uhm for the next 2-3 months, I can purchase that. And then, uh, actually I don't have yung parang pinakamaraming inventory because I really calculate, okay yung calculation ko. But right now, since na nag reretailing na kami, I think na parang it's slower kaya I have to adjust nanaman. So nandito lang kami sa medyo nasa beginning palang ako, on my second year of retailing eh kaya iniistudy ko pa yung how will I purchase na hindi ako mauubusan, pero I have sale naman, I will have sale items every now and then. Halimbawa for like the racks outside, pag yung mga stocks ko wala na yung colors, tapos konti nalang yung sizes, broken, tapos talaga hindi na talaga siya nagmomove, that's the only time I put it outside the rack and then put sale.
Interviewer:
So, yun po lang yung ano yun. That's one of the only ways you get rid of stocks?
Client:
Oo
Interviewer:
Hindi po yung, like talagang wala lang.
Client:
Ay no, no.
Interviewer:
No, you don't.
Client:
I value my ano, my stocks. Hindi talaga. Tapos, uh I also go to bazaars para yung hindi rin namin mabenta in the store.
Interviewer:
I-aano po dun sa bazaar?
Client:
Yeah kaya I do bazaar every month. Sometime I have 3 times a month, sometimes I have, like in December parang everyday I'm in the bazaar talaga. So basically talaga I work out, I work it out, all the stocks that I have kailangan ko ibenta.
Interviewer:
Ah okay. As you mentioned earlier po, yung ano, yung stocks niyo po dito sometimes it goes missing parang miscalculations, tama ba?
Client:
Oo.
Interviewer:
Uh, paano niyo po na.
Client:
Ah no, in the ano, in Cinderella branches.
Interviewer:
In Cinderella branches.
Client:
Oo, in Cinderella branches. Kasi here, uhm, di ko masabi na nawawalan ako kasi di ako nagbibilang. Di ako nagbibilang dito, sa Cinderella nag bibilang ako. Kaya sabi ko how much more if I will count this one? Probably I will really have a headache.
Interviewer:
So in Cinderella din po you experienced losses din.
Client:
Yeah, I experience like 2 piece 3pcs, 5pcs. Sometimes I have 50 pcs. Ay uh.. This is my daily sale. (Show Daily Sale Logbook)
Interviewer:
These are the logbooks that ano.
Client:
Yeah, they write on.
Interviewer:
Yung pinag tatake down nila.
Client:
So yun sila.
Interviewer:
Eto yung mga banks
Client:
So, quantities
Interviewer:
Quantity, price. Uh.
Client:
Price
Interviewer:
Uh, item. The name.
Client:
And the one who sold it.
Interviewer:
Ah, the one who sold it.
Client:
Yeah oo. So this is for the day. At the end of the day, kailangan mag tatally yung dedeposit ko for the, with the sale.
Interviewer:
Ah okay, I get it.
Client:
Yan, 15,000 yan cash deposit. Tapos may mga expenses sila uh kailangan kung ano yung net nandito sa bank kahit wala kami. So this is another example of, I think they have kaya naka 45,000 there's somewhere there na nakakuha siguro sila ng wholesale.
Interviewer:
Oh, what's this po?
Client:
May I see? Ah, they totaled it sometimes.
Interviewer:
Ah yan na yung total.
Client:
Oo, yan total. Tapos uh yeah. There's a wholesale 34,950.
Interviewer:
Hindi po nila nakikita, nilagay nalang dito.
Client:
Oo, nilagay niya lang diyan. Pero sometimes, nilalagay niya dyan. So yun yung total sale. Pero this one is balanced because it's a collectible pa to; nag sisign lang yung customer, tapos they will send a check, so for collection pa to.
Interviewer:
Uh, so san po ba kayo nag kakaproblem like, diba sa daily po or namention niyo po kanina na dinedeclare nila as wholesale instead of retail.
Client:
Uh, that is the worst thing that I don't want to happen, kasi naiisip ko na yun na pwede nila gawin pero actually wala pa ako nahuhuli kasi very ano naman kasi naandyan naman kami, we know pero the thing is when we go to vacation kasi this 34,950 if it's not a wholesale it's hundred thousand, hundred or 80,000 yan probably. Kasi over talaga yung price, so that is the problem that they will, you know they can, they can do kaya, kaya noon ko parin iniisip yun eh if I will have a barcode papano yung wholesale, diba papano yung system na yun. So parang it's hard to reconcile if you will based on the amount and if you will based it on the quantity mahirap din because they don't have the same price.
Interviewer:
So, uh..
Client:
Eto here, I have also here na like this, MC is credit card, Mastercard, so wala yan sa cash. So my instruction is put it in a box, nakabox iyan pero di nila binox.
Interviewer:
Oh you have a machine?
Client:
Yes, swiper. So that's it, so kaya nileless nila yun. This is the cash deposit tapos this is the MC the mastercard, they have to attach this everyday para alam ko yung walang cash.
Interviewer:
So uhm.
Client:
So basically I have uh mastercard, I have also those people who will just signed so its balanced, sometimes I have wholesale that they pay in cash pero they declare it right here at the end of the day. So much complicated yung dito kasi sa Divisoria eh, complicated to pero yung sa retailing ko it's just fine eh.
Interviewer:
Just fine because yung inventory niyo po you have a total of everything. Yung magulo lang po yung dito.
Client:
Yeah, kaya we cannot afford to really go out of the country kasi walang inventory talaga yan, that's my problem.
Interviewer:
Okay, in the past week po did you have any errors when it comes to uh, yung pagka log in any errors in the process, yung buong process in the inventory? For example, like uh, may nagkamali ng sulat and then mali yung deposit, something like that.
Client:
Ah yeah, I encounter that parang once a week meron yung problem. Pero I can resolve it naman kasi I ask the girl kung sino nag benta nito, sometimes sabi nila sakin "ay ate nakalimutan ko isulat kaya hindi nag tally" or sometimes naman "dalawang beses pala ako nag sulat, akala ko hindi ko nasulat kanina, nasulat ko pala" so at the end of the day parang dun ko makikita 'bakit kulang tayo 100, o bakit sobra tayong 100' nako, tapos papakita ko sakanila yan para makita nila kung saan sila nagkamali. Pero as far I'm concern I know that they're honest mistake kasi I'm there naman kasi, I'm the one who open the store.
Interviewer:
And then one you noticed those mistake, you just simply modify lang?
Client:
Yeah, parang nakalagay dito we over ng 200 ganun tas lalagyan nalang namin ng over ng 100, at tska parang short ng 500.
Interviewer:
Ano lang po, how many sales lady you have here po?
Client:
Uh, average of 3 saleslady.
Interviewer:
Uhm, how long do they, do they have shifts?
Client:
Uhm no, kasi 9 hours to 10 hours eh, so basically sila rin yung morning to end.
Interviewer:
Pero yung for example for the whole month, they don't change po ba? Di kayo nag papalit ng saleslady, permanent sila dun?
Client:
They have 1 day off in a week. Before kasi I used to have them rotate, sabi ko 1 month dun kayo sa kabila 1 month dito kayo sa kabila, but then there are issues like personality issues na, hindi sila mag click pag mag kasama sila, maiinis lang yung mga customer, sabi ko osige dyan ka nalang para di narin kami ma ano. So yun, pero I do that once a month.
Interviewer:
Pero hindi po sila come and go, for example, nag apply po sila ngayon tapos next month wala na po sila.
Client:
Ay may mga ganun, I encounter yan, parang meron yung iba dyan 1 day lang, yung iba dyan 3 days, yung iba dyan 1 month, yung iba dyan 2 months, pero at least 80% stays.




Client:
Eto pala yung ano ko, I call it annual report, I have parang the summary of everything, so this is 2006, I have 3 stores before, one this 2G 1 store, 3D, and then I have the Baclaran.
Interviewer:
Okay so eto pong tatlo?
Client:
tatlo lang yan, but my income is 7 uh, how much. Average monthly ko to eh, so this is my, this is the gross eh, ah the net 5.8. Eto yung annual report yan, so this is my net, net na to. So basically you know how close, this is the capital yung for a month yung sabi ko sainyo na I go out. This is the date I go out, this is my capital and then this is my sales tapos I will subtract that then this is my net. So ganun ko ginagawa, but now it's more complicated because marami na yung stores ko before I have only three. So here, this is the period when I'm out 887,000 and the 3S-12 yung tindahan ko na to, eto yung binenta niya gross, yung 3D ko yung other store eto yung binenta niya with this capital ah, tapos yung small case ko sa Baclaran eto yung binenta niya for a month, tapos yung Cinderella ko I consolidated, so I have before 3 branches so these 3 branches pero ni-less ko na yung 30% ng Cinderella kasi 70% lang yung saakin so para etong, kung ano yung nasa akin yun lang yun, yung net of 70%.
Interviewer:
Okay..
Client:
So out na yung 30% nun, this is mine. So I calculate everything the total of all my stores and I will subtract it from this capital and this is my net, so I do that, ngayon hindi ko siya natapos kasi November 28 until my last, my last trip was November 28 so nag out ako ng like 1.2M here di parin ako lumalakad eh, so I will go next week January 18, so I will write again another capital of mine. Tapos I will close this na if that stocks come. So I will have the net of everything on February. Malalaman ko na kung ano yung binenta ko for the whole year so kaya wala pa ako annual report for this year, tapos I have also the bazaars. These are the bazaars that I joined, so I have total of 1.4 gross of the bazaar for the whole year. So for the whole year na.
Interviewer:
Uhm, how do you know po ba kung ano, for example you have this stock paano niyo malalaman na stock niyo yung parang need this set of piece.
Client:
Ah, monthly, I should go monthly.
Interviewer:
Ah, so not by quantity?
Client:
Kasi ako inaapproximate ko lang eh, so pag nakikita ko na yung benta ko at least I got my capital already it's time to go. I I got my capital, it's time to go pero I see to it na I would just buy those things that are gone tapos I won't buy yung things na natitira, so parang I just replenish.
Interviewer:
So there is no actual record of everything parang dito sa Cinderella, dito lang sa store na to there's this list.
Client:
Sa Cinderella I have count of.
Interviewer:
Ah yung mga list of products, ah list of items you have a list?
Client:
In Cinderella, pero here in my 2 stores I don't, pero kasi every time I'm there parang I'm so familiar with it, that I know how many in my mind.
Interviewer:
So ano lang parang approximate?
Client:
Parang tanchahan lang, yeah. Natatancha ko lang siya.
Interviewer:
Sa logbook po na daily, how do you name the products?
Client:
Uh, I just name it as yung may category: dress, blouse, accessesories, belts, bags, gowns. Yun lang yung lang mga ano ko.
Interviewer:
Under po nun, may specific names sila?
Client:
Wala eh. Kasi ganito lang siya eh, nakita mo pag nag report sila nakita mo dress lang tapos sale. Wala talaga ako parang definite.
Interviewer:
Ah so, you go to Hongkong every month diba?
Client:
Yeah every month.
Interviewer:
So every month po, you don't buy the same stocks?
Client:
Uhm, I have a line na finofollow ko. Kasi I'm more on corporate and cocktail and party dresses. So kung ano lang yung uso for the month but that category also, I will buy that. So every time I have to have new items pero you know the same category like you know still a party dress, still a corporate dress for offices.
Interviewer:
So yung mga nabibili niyo po sa Hongkong, you take note of the capital, that's one and
Client:
The quantity also
Interviewer:
Quantity of?
Client:
Of the one that I man kasi ang mali ang inventory naman dito is I have those stocks kasi syempre you have to know if the shipment is really under it, kung wala silang kinukuha during shipment or walang loss/losses during the shipment. So that's the time I count, so every time that I'm out of the country I buy then I have this invoice, mga OR and then I keep that. After a month, kasi shipment is one month eh. The girls will receive it here kasi andito na yung cargo eh, andito lahat ng cargo dyan, so they just bring down the stuff and I tell them to write so they have a separate logbook for all the items that are coming. So, sabihin nila this number of loss, stock number tapos I receive 50 pcs I will reconcile that with what I have in my, the one that I paid in Hongkong. So basically wala akong problema lahat ng quantity nadedeliver nila, so that's the only time I count pero yung sasabihin mo na after a month magkano na yung nabenta ko, ilan nalang natira, wala na ako ano dun, just the coming stocks I have pero yung reconciliation niya after the sales wala na ako nun.
Interviewer:
Okay, since wala pa naman follow-up questions dito, let's move on to sa mga technical stuff. Again you have a, yung total branches that you have is yung the ones here, yung dalawa dito sa 168, the one in Glorietta, ay hindi san yung isa?
Client:
Dalawa sa 168 isa sa Baclaran. Yun yung mga wholesale/retail yan e kaya wala kang console dyan e. And you really have to visit them.
Interviewer:
So yung 5 naman retail
Client:
Yung 5 naman retail lang.
Interviewer:
Uhm wait, question for a while ago, so you record your sales through the category is dress, but when you get stocks, when stocks are coming, do you also write up there like number of items for dress
Client:
Yeah when it comes, there is uh number of receipt that I have in from Hongkong, I keep it and then I reconcile it with the ones coming. So that is the only one the I record naman separately on my book, so those are the total quantity of the shipment per order after that I don’t have na, I don’t keep track of what they have sold out.
Interviewer:
So, yung mga locations po other than the retail, are there available computer?
Client:
Sorry?
Interviewer:
May mga computers po ba for the branch like yung retail and wholesale, yung tatlo.
Client:
Dito wala kaming computers, I don't use computers here. Sa Cinderella they have there.
Interviewer:
Yung lima.
Client:
Yung lima, yeah pero on my own from Cinderella I don’t have a computer eh. The Cinderella just print it out for me from their computer.
Interviewer:
Pero, for the software that's we're going make you meron naman possible na malalagyan ng software.
Client:
Ah yeah, that's what I need nga eh. Parang I want really to fix everything in the store, to make it you know modernized. Not like this old school na nag susulat, kasi I'm really so
Interviewer:
Nakakadrain po.
Client:
Nakakadrain talaga really, so sabi ko I have to have a computer that will compute everything for me.
Interviewer:

Client:

Interviewer:
So uhm, you're considering putting up computers in the store, are you also considering for internet connection?
Client:

Client:
